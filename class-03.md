# List

  HTML provides us with three different types:
  
  ## Ordered lists :
 
   Are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example,a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
  
  
   **< ol >**
   
   The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.
  
  
   **< li >**
   
   Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing < /li > tag. **(The li stands for list item.)**
      
   Example :
      
        <ol>
        <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
         <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
        minutes until tender</li>
        <li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
        <li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
        </ol>

 ### Unordered lists :
 
   Are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
   
   
   **< ul >**
   
     The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.
  
  
  **< li >**
  
     Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing < /li > tag. (The li stands for list item.)
     
     
  # Example :
  
  
         <ul>
         <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
         <li>100ml milk</li>
         <li>50g salted butter</li>
         <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
         <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
         </ul>

 ### Definition lists :
 
   Are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
