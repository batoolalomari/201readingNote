# OBJECT

##  What is an Object?

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names.

### Property

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES 
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a 
property. Properties tell us about the object, such as 
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. 
Each individual hotel might have a different name 
and a different number of rooms. 


### Method


IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS 
If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
Methods represent tasks that are associated with 
the object. For example, you can check how many 
rooms are available by subtracting the number of 
booked rooms from the total number of rooms.
