   Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another.
   
   
   ## Writing Links
   
   Links are created using the < a > element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

  The text between the opening < a > tag and closing < /a > tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken .To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to.
