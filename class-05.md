  ## How to add images to pages ?
  
   There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
   
   <img>  To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element, which is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).
   
  ### It must carry the following two attributes :
  
- src

This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

- alt
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

**Title** : 
You can also use the title attribute with the < img > element to provide additional information about the image. 
Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.
