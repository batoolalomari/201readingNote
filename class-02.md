## Bold & Italic

  **< b> ** : By enclosing words in the tags **< b > and < /b >** we can make characters appear bold.

  **< i >** :  By enclosing words in the tags **< i > and < /i >** we can make characters appear italic.

## Superscript & Subscript

   **< sup >** : The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
   
   **< sub >** : The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

   **< br >** :By Using < br > you add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag < br />.
   
   **< hr / >**  you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the < hr /> tag. There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are **known as empty elements** and they are written differently.

    An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character.
